## Developing a Bot to play Valorant on my behalf

I want this bot to mimic my style of playing and I am training it by recording my own games and using that as data.

We as humans are able to grasp what is going on in the game fairly easily so I want to demo this for fun and checkout if I could increase my ranking in any better way

Also, I want the best possible user experience. So a single key, or a ixed idle time should trigger the bot to play and disengagement should also be very smooth. If a user is trying to take control by just shifting the mouse slightly or by pressing a key, auto-pilot should disengage and let user play
